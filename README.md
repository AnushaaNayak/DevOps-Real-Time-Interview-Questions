It facilitates communication between resources in different VPCs as if they were on the same network.

### Question 66: What is CloudFront?
**Answer**:  
Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) service that accelerates the delivery of web content to users around the world with low latency and high transfer speeds. CloudFront caches copies of static and dynamic content at edge locations close to end-users, reducing the latency of requests and improving website performance. It also provides protection against DDoS attacks and offers real-time monitoring and analytics for content delivery.

### Question 67: What is the use of the IAM role?
**Answer**:  
IAM roles are used to delegate permissions to entities that you trust within your AWS account. They are commonly used to grant permissions to AWS services, such as EC2 instances or Lambda functions, allowing them to access other AWS resources without the need for long-term security credentials. IAM roles provide a secure way to grant temporary access to resources and follow the principle of least privilege by only granting the permissions required for a specific task.

### Question 68: How many subnets assign to the routing table?
**Answer**:  
Multiple subnets can be associated with a single routing table in a VPC. Each subnet in a VPC must be associated with a routing table, which determines how traffic is routed within the VPC and to destinations outside the VPC.

### Question 69: What

 is the static IP?
**Answer**:  
A static IP (Internet Protocol) address is a fixed IP address assigned to a device or resource that does not change over time. In AWS, Elastic IP (EIP) addresses are static IP addresses that you can allocate and associate with EC2 instances, NAT gateways, or Network Load Balancers. Unlike dynamic IP addresses, which can change each time a device connects to the network, static IP addresses remain constant, making them suitable for scenarios where consistent addressing is required.

### Question 70: How will you get access to private subnets?
**Answer**:  
To access resources in private subnets within a VPC, you can use one of the following methods:
1. **VPN Connection**: Establish a VPN connection between your on-premises network and the VPC to access resources securely.
2. **Direct Connect**: Set up a dedicated network connection between your on-premises data center and the VPC for private connectivity.
3. **Bastion Host or Jump Server**: Deploy a bastion host or jump server in a public subnet to proxy connections to resources in private subnets.
4. **NAT Gateway/NAT Instance**: Route traffic from private subnets through a NAT gateway or NAT instance in a public subnet to access the internet or other AWS services.

4. Configure logging, replication, and lifecycle policies to automate data management and ensure compliance.
5. Optionally, enable features such as event notifications, static website hosting, or cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) based on your requirements.
6. Click on "Create bucket" to finalize the configuration.

### Question 90: What are EC2 and VPC, and how do we create & write a script?
**Answer**:  
- **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**: A web service provided by AWS that allows users to launch and manage virtual servers (instances) in the cloud.
- **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**: A virtual network infrastructure that enables users to launch AWS resources in a logically isolated section of the AWS cloud.

To create an EC2 instance, you can use the AWS Management Console,

 AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs. Here's a basic example of writing a script to create an EC2 instance using the AWS CLI:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Set variables
AMI_ID="your-ami-id"
INSTANCE_TYPE="t2.micro"
KEY_NAME="your-key-name"
SUBNET_ID="your-subnet-id"
SECURITY_GROUP_ID="your-security-group-id"

# Run instance
aws ec2 run-instances \
    --image-id $AMI_ID \
    --instance-type $INSTANCE_TYPE \
    --key-name $KEY_NAME \
    --subnet-id $SUBNET_ID \
    --security-group-ids $SECURITY_GROUP_ID \
    --count 1
```

This script uses the AWS CLI (`aws ec2 run-instances` command) to launch a single EC2 instance with the specified parameters, such as the AMI ID, instance type, key pair name, subnet ID, and security group ID. You can save this script as a `.sh` file and execute it to create an EC2 instance.
