Sure, here are the questions and answers labeled accordingly:

### Question 1: Stopping vs. Terminating an EC2 Instance
**Answer**:  
Stopping an instance is like putting it on pause; it retains its configuration, data, and associated resources (like Elastic IPs). Terminating an instance, on the other hand, is like shutting it down permanently; it removes all data, configurations, and associated resources.

### Question 2: Adding an Existing Instance to a New Auto Scaling Group
**Answer**:  
You can't directly add an existing instance to a new Auto Scaling group. Instead, you can create a new launch configuration for the Auto Scaling group with the same configuration as the existing instance, then update the Auto Scaling group to use the new launch configuration.

### Question 3: Configuring CloudWatch to Recover an EC2 Instance
**Answer**:  
You can configure CloudWatch to recover an EC2 instance by setting up a CloudWatch alarm to monitor instance health or system status checks. Then, configure the alarm to trigger an action, such as recovering the instance, when certain conditions are met.

### Question 4: Difference between Latency Based Routing and Geo DNS
**Answer**:  
Latency Based Routing directs traffic based on the lowest network latency to the user. Geo DNS directs traffic based on the user's geographical location. While both aim to optimize performance, Latency Based Routing focuses on network latency, whereas Geo DNS focuses on geographic proximity.
