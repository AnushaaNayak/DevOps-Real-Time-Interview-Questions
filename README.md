A domain is a user-friendly name used to access resources on the internet (e.g., example.com). A hosted zone, on the other hand, is a container for DNS records that define how traffic is routed for a specific domain. Essentially, a domain represents the name, while a hosted zone contains the DNS records associated with that name.

### Question 8: Elements of an AWS CloudFormation template
**Answer**:  
The elements of an AWS CloudFormation template include resources, parameters, mappings, outputs, conditions, and metadata. Resources define the AWS infrastructure components to be provisioned, parameters allow customization of the template, mappings provide conditional mappings, outputs display information about the stack, conditions define when resources are created, and metadata offers additional information about the template.

### Question 9: What happens in CloudFormation when one of the resources in a stack cannot be created successfully?
**Answer**:  
If one of the resources in a CloudFormation stack cannot be created successfully, CloudFormation rolls back the entire stack to its previous state. This rollback ensures that the stack remains consistent and that resources are not left in an incomplete or inconsistent state.

### Question 10: Steps involved in a CloudFormation Solution
**Answer**:  
1. **Design Template**: Create a CloudFormation template defining the infrastructure resources and their configurations.
2. **Validate Template**: Use CloudFormation's template validation feature to ensure the template syntax is correct.
3. **Create Stack**: Deploy the CloudFormation stack using the template, which provisions the defined resources.
4. **Monitor Stack**: Monitor the stack creation process and verify the successful creation of resources.
5. **Update Stack**: As needed, make changes to the template and update the stack to reflect those changes.
6. **Delete Stack**: When the resources are no longer needed, delete the CloudFormation stack to remove all associated resources and avoid unnecessary costs.
