### Question 124: How many subnets assign to the routing table?
**Answer**:  
- **Subnets Assigned to Routing Table**: In a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) in AWS, each subnet must be associated with one and only one route table at a time. However, a route table can be associated with multiple subnets. This means that you can have multiple subnets within a VPC all using the same route table to determine where network traffic is routed.

### Question 125: What is the static IP?
**Answer**:  
- **Static IP**: A static IP address is an IP address that remains fixed and does not change over time. Unlike dynamic IP addresses, which are assigned dynamically by a DHCP server and may change each time a device connects to the network, static IP addresses are manually configured and remain constant. Static IP addresses are commonly used for servers, routers, and network devices that require consistent and predictable network addresses for remote access, hosting services, or security configurations.

### Question 126: How will you get access to private subnets?
**Answer**:  
- **Access to Private Subnets**: To access resources deployed in private subnets within a VPC, you typically use one of the following methods:
  - **VPN Connection**: Establish a VPN (Virtual Private Network) connection between your on-premises network and the VPC to access resources securely over a private network.
  - **Direct Connect**: Set up a dedicated network connection between your on-premises data center and the VPC using AWS Direct Connect for private, high-bandwidth connectivity.
  - **Bastion Host or Jump Server**: Deploy a bastion host or jump server in a public subnet with SSH or RDP access, and then use it as a gateway to access resources in private subnets.

### Question 127: Can you increase the size of the root volume without shutting down the instance?
**Answer**:  
- **Increasing Root Volume Size**: Yes, you can increase the size of the root volume (EBS volume) attached to an EC2 instance without shutting down the instance. However, the process may vary depending on the operating system and filesystem used on the root volume. For most Linux-based instances, you can resize the root volume while the instance is running by modifying the volume size in the AWS Management Console or using the AWS CLI. Once the volume is resized, you may need to resize the filesystem and extend the partition to utilize the additional space.
